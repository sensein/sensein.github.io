# Learn About the Mumble Melody Study

<br />

**Who We Are:** 

We are a group of researchers from MIT exploring new auditory feedback modalities to help increase fluency for People Who Stutter (PWS). Our iPhone app Mumble Melody provides different modes that alter your voice in real time. 
The Mumble Melody app is a work-in-progress based on our research that aims to gather user feedback and better understand what aspects of the experience are most important for PWS.

**Background:** 

Stuttering affects 1% of adults and 8% of children, and there are 70 million PWS worldwide. Stuttering-like-disfluencies include blocks, repetitions, and prolongations. While there is no cure for stuttering, the Mumble Melody team is investigating audio-based approaches that may help increase fluency for people who stutter.

**About This Study:**

We are currently running a feedback study to get input on our app from PWS. If you are eligible, all you need to do is download the app, try using the app in your own time, and answer built-in feedback questions. We wonâ€™t be collecting any personal data or voice data.
Below is more information on the study, eligibility criteria, and instructions to download the app:

**Study Video:**

If you are interested in learning more about this study, watch [this video](https://youtu.be/_74DMatudKQ).

**Using the Mumble Melody App:**

To use the app, you will need wired headphones/earbuds with an embedded microphone. Bluetooth headphones or speakers will not work as they may create a feedback effect.

You can use the app by yourself for speech training or during discussion. You can also explore the different modes and presets to find the least distracting and most efficient for you. If you believe a mode is beginning to lose effect after a few hours/days, consider switching to a different mode.

**Disclaimer:**

The approach provided in our study does not intend to cure or fix stuttering. Stuttering is a very complex condition, still not completely understood by the research community, and it comes with influential social and identity-forging elements. Our goal through distributing this app is to gather feedback from potential users to help improve the science and research on stuttering. Please be aware that the research is ongoing, and Musically Modulated Auditory Feedback might not work for all users. The Mumble Melody application will automatically deactivate in about a month. Our tool is designed for adults (18+) only.
